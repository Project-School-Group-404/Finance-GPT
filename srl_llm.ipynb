      "4. Calculus: Involves the study of rates of change and accumulation of quantities. It has two branches: differential calculus, which deals with the study of rates of change, and integral calculus, which deals with the accumulation of quantities.\n",
      "5. Statistics: Involves the analysis of data and the use of statistical methods to make inferences.\n",
      "6. Probability: Involves the study of the likelihood of events occurring.\n",
      "7. Linear Algebra: Involves the study of vectors and linear maps between vector spaces.\n",
      "8. Number Theory: Deals with properties and relationships of numbers.\n",
      "9. Combinatorics: Deals with counting and arranging objects.\n",
      "10. Logic: Deals with the principles of reasoning.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, depending on your field of study, you may need to take advanced topics such as abstract algebra, differential equations, topology, real analysis, and more. It's always best to consult with a math advisor at your school to ensure that you are taking the right courses for your program.\n",
